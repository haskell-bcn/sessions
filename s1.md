# Pure functional programming

From Wikipedia:

> In computer science, <b>functional programming</b> is a programming paradigm
<br> that treats computation as the <b>evaluation</b> of mathematical <b>functions</b>
<br> and avoids <b>changing-state</b> and <b>mutable data</b>. (...) ($\to$ <b>functional</b>)

> It is a <b>declarative</b> (the what) programming paradigm, which means
<br> programming is done with <b>expressions</b> or <b>declarations</b>
<br> instead of <b>statements</b> (the how). (...)

> In functional code, the <b>output value</b> of a function <b>depends only</b>
<br> on the arguments that are <b>input</b> to the function, so calling a
<br> function $f$ twice with the same value for an argument $x$ will produce
<br> the same result $f(x)$ each time. (...) ($\to$ <b>purity</b>)

# Related concepts

* Purity ($\to$ referential transparency):
    * Every function $f$ is a function in the mathematical sense:
        * Every *input* has its corresponding *output*
        * Same *input* produces same *output*, **always**
        * Order does not matter
        * Easy concurrency
* Laziness:
    * Nothing evaluates unless necessary
    * Inner-most expressions first (**call by name**)
    * Allows:
        * Infinite data structures
        * Recursive types
        * Recursive functions
    * Category theory (**functor**, **monoid**, **monad**, and many other buzzwords)
* Reasoning ($\gets$ purity):

>"The central idea of pure functional programming is to structure
<br> our programs in such a way that we can reason about them as
<br> a system of equations just like we can in mathematics." **Stephen Diehl**

# Pros & Cons

* Advantages:
    * Maintainability
    * Testability
    * Increase of productivity
    * Code reuse, easier refactoring
    * Great levels of abstraction (**use carefully!**)
    * Better reasoning
    * Developer happiness

* Disadvantages:
    * For developers, steep learning curve
    * For companies, small pool of developers

# Why Haskell ? (I)

## if...

* Not much used, *academia* language
* *Strange* syntax
* *Strange concepts* (**Monads!?**)
* **Steep** learning curve
* **Immutable**

## because...

* *We are very smart!* (not really, definitely)
* *We want to show off!* (poor us...)
* *We are dumb* (and it helps to program **better**)

# Why Haskell ? (II)

> If Haskell is so great, why isn't it more popular?

# Why Haskell ? (III)

Actually it is a really **unfair analogy**:

* Coders solving nowadays increasingly difficult problems using "traditional"
<br> tools are the real heroes of the story
* Using Haskell is more about making your code live more **productive** and **enjoyable**
<br> and not the opposite
* Problems of traditional approaches:
    * Concurrency:
        * OOP encourages *dangerous* and *buggy* design
    * Side effects:
        * **Don't scale**, and **imperative programming** is all about side effects
        * The fact they are **"hidden"** makes them impossible to manage in the large
* How does Haskell tackle this problems?
    * **Explicit side effects**, clear separation between *pure* and *impure* code
    * **Immutability**
    * **Functional patterns** $\to$ composability
    * A very expressive **type system**

* Functions<br>

* Basic data types<br>
* Typeclasses<br>
* Functional patterns<br>

# Expressions

* Everything in Haskell is an *expression* or *declaration*
* Basic unit of a Haskell program
* Expressions may be:
    * Values
    * Combination of values
    * Functions applied to values
* An Expression can be composed of sub-expressions
* Expressions *evaluate* to a *result*
* The following are all expressions:
    ```haskell
    1
    1 + 1
    "Hello, world!"
    ```

# Types (I)

* Every expression has a *type*
* Types are a way of categorizing values
* Some basic types:
    * Numbers (whether they are integers, fractional numbers, etc.)
    * Boolean values
    * Characters or strings
    * Lists
    * Functions: *`type1 -> type2`* a function from `type1` to `type2`
    * Tuples: *`(type1, type2, ..., typeN)`*
    * Unit: *`()`* a zero-tuple (kind of like `void` in C)
* We can inspect the type of an expression using the `:t` command in the `GHCi`
    ```haskell
    Prelude> :t True
    True :: Bool
    Prelude> :t "Haskell"
    "Haskell" :: [Char]
    ```

# Types (II)

## User defined data types

* The `data` keyword declares user-defined data types:
    ```haskell
    data Point = Point Double Double deriving Show
    ```
    * Declares new type `Point` with constructor `Point` containing two `Double`s
    * `deriving Show` means you can print the type (handy in `GHCi`)
    * We can also derive `Read`, `Eq`, `Enum`, `Bounded`
* Data types and constructors *must* start with capital letters
* Types and constructors can use the same name
* One type can have multiple constructors:
    ```haskell
    data Color = Red | Green | Blue deriving Show
    ```

# Functions (I)

* As in **lambda calculus**, all functions take one argument at a time and return only
<br> one result ($\to$ *currying*, partial application by default)
* When defining functions, capitalization matters: they always start with a lowercase letter.
<br> Variables also start lowercase
* Haskell compiles tail recursive functions to loops.
* To define a function or value in `GCHi`, you must use `let`:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> let double x = x * 2
    ```
* Functions also have a type! Functions are statically typed, provided or inferred by the type system
    ```haskell
    :t double
    double :: Num a => a -> a
    ```

# Functions (II)

* Let's inspect this function:
    ```
    double x    =   x * 2
    [1]   [2]  [3]   [4]
    ```
    1. Name of the function we are defining
    2. Argument of our function ("head" of a lambda)
    3. The `=` is used to define (or **declare**) values and functions. This is not how we
    <br> define equality between two values in Haskell
    4. Function body
* Calling the function by name and introducing a value for the $x$ argument makes our
<br> function a **reducible** expression:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> double 2
    4
    ```
* We can define **lambdas** using anonymous function syntax:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> (\x -> x) 0
    0
    ```

# Infix operators

* Default is **prefix syntax**, meaning that the function being applied is at the beginning
<br> of the expression rather than in the middle
* Not all functions are prefix though, e.g. arithmetic operators
* All operators are functions, not all functions are operators
    ```haskell
    Prelude> 1 + 1
    2
    Prelude> (+) 1 1
    2
    ```
* As in math, there is a default associativty and precedence for infix operators. We can ask
<br> `GHCi` for information such as this by using the `:i` command:
    ```haskell
    Prelude> :i (+)
    class Num a where
      (+) :: a -> a -> a
      ...
          -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
    infixl 6 +
    Prelude> :i (*)
    class Num a where
      ...
      (*) :: a -> a -> a
       ...
          -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
    infixl 7 *
    ```

# Bindings

* Use `=` to define a variable or function
    ```haskell
    x = 1                       -- Two hyphens introduce a comment
    y = 2                       -- ... that continues to the end of the line
    main1 = let z = x + y       -- let introduces local bindings
            in print z
    main2 = print z             -- same does where
            where z = x + y
    ```
    * Bound names cannot start with upper-case letters
    * Indentation is very important
* Bound names (variable, function, etc.) are:
    * **Immutable**: only one binding for symbol and scope
    * **Order independent**: order of bindings does not matter in source code
    * **Lazy**: bindings are only evaluated when necessary
    * **Recursive**: the bound symbol is in the scope of its own definition

# Typeclasses (I)

A **typeclass** is some sort of interface which defines a behavior.

* `Eq`: implements equality
* `Num`: implemented by most numeric types
* `Ord`: defines an order
* `Enum`: for things enumerable, which have known predecessors and successors
* `Show`: provides for the creating of human-readable string representations of
<br> structured data:
* `Read`: opposite of `Show`, its use *should* be avoided
* And many more, stay tuned!

# Functional patterns

* Pattern matching<br>
* Case expressions<br>
* Higer-order functions<br>
* Guards<br>

# Pattern matching

Pattern matching is a way of matching values against patterns and, where appropriate
<br> binding them to successful matches ($\to$ deconstruction).

We can match over:

* Any value:
    ```haskell
    isItOne :: Integer -> Bool
    isItOne 1 = True
    isItOne _ = False
    ```
* Data constructors:
    ```haskell
    newtype Username = Username String
    data User = Guest | User Username
    printUser :: User -> IO ()
    printUser Guest = putStrLn "Guest"
    printUser (User (Username name)) = putStrLn $ "Registered user: " ++ name
    ```
* Pattern matching **must** be **exhaustive**, otherwise an error will pop up

# Case expressions vs Guards

## Case expressions

* Pretty similar to `if-then-else` expressions, of making a function
<br> return differently based on different inputs
* Can be used with any data type that has visible data constructors:
    ```haskell
    pal :: String -> String
    pal xs =
      case xs == reverse xs of
        True -> "yes"
        False -> "no"
    ```

## Guards

Guard syntax allows us to write compact functions that allow for two or more possible <br> outcomes depending on the truth value of the conditions.

```haskell
myAbs :: Integer -> Integer
myAbs x
  | x < 0       = (-x)
  | otherwise   = x
```

# Higher-order functions

Functions that accept functions as arguments or return functions themselves.

```haskell
Prelude> :t map
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
Prelude> map (+1) [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
Prelude> :t flip
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
Prelude> flip (-) 1 2
1
```

# Getting started with Haskell

* Install [Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
    * `brew install haskell-stack`
    * `stack setup && stack upgrade`
* Create a file called `hello.hs` with the following contents:

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
```

* Compile your program to a native executable like this:
```
$ stack ghc hello.hs
  [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( hello.hs, hello.o )
  Linking hello ...
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
```

* Or run it in the `GHCi` like this:
```
$ stack ghci
  GHCi, version 7.10.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
  ...
  Prelude> :load hello.hs
  Ok, modules loaded: Main.
  *Main> main
  Hello, world!
  *Main>
```
